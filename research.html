<h2> Research Interests </h2>
My doctoral research focused on factors linked to the emergence or abscence of a bilingual executive function advantage. Bilinguals 
constantly have to manage which language the actively use, which means they have to "inhibit" or "ignore" interference from one language
in order to use another language. It has previously been hypothesised that this "practice" of deploying attention effectively may 
generalise to other, no-linguistic domains and thus improve executive function in bilinguals. Working in this area provided me
with an opportunity to combine Psycholinguistics (e.g. language production and comprehension) and cognitive processes linked to attention.


Prior to my doctoral research, I was involved in projects related to Social Cognition, Mental Health, Attention/Perception, 
and Brain Imaging.
